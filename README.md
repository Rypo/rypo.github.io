## Content

### Notebooks
90% is old Jupyter/Rmd notebook analysis from 2018-2019. These parallel analyses were conducted in both Python and R. This may be useful to anyone trying to learn either R or Python who is already familiar with the other language since they demonstrate how to accomplish (almost) the same thing in both languages.

### Blog
The remaining content may one day be musings about various open-source projects I've created.

### Theme
